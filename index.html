            <h3 class="section-title"> Overview </h3>
            <p> Currently a Student at Mt San Antonio College, studying Mechanical Engineering, I may not be a specialist in any one category, however I have learned and adapted exceedingly well to a wide variety of skills and situations, I can find and come up with creative and alternative solutions to problems, and while my academic journey has been a challenge in the face of ADHD and Dyslexia, I have found ways to utilize them and turn a disability into an ability; I am quick to adapt in intense and chaotic situations, I excell in my ability to process, visualize, and think in 3 dimensions, I have a hard time starting large tasks but can fixate and focus on them for extended periods of time, I don't learn as fast as others, but I learn more deeply, and generally once I understand something I know it thoroughly. I Struggled through basics for reading and writing, but still receive high grades, and have come to excel in physics, mathematics, science, and engineering. Several of the jobs I've had are because I was Passionate about them and had received excellent experiences in them. I am looking to get in the field and gain hands on experience with Mechanical Engineering, through research, projects, teams, and Internships. </p>
